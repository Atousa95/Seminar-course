             <l>Because I could not stop for Death –</l>
             <l>He kindly stopped for me –</l>
             <l>The Carriage held but just Ourselves –</l>
             <l>And Immortality.</l>
             <l>We slowly drove – He knew no haste</l>
             <l>And I had put away</l>
             <l>My labor and my leisure too,</l>
             <l>For His Civility –</l>
             <l>We passed the School, where Children strove</l>
             <l>At Recess – in the Ring –</l>
             <l>We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –</l>
             <l>We passed the Setting Sun –</l>
             <l>Or rather – He passed Us –</l>
             <l>The Dews drew quivering and Chill –</l>
             <l>For only Gossamer, my Gown –</l>
             <l>My Tippet – only Tulle –</l>
             <l>We paused before a House that seemed</l>
             <l>A Swelling of the Ground –</l>
             <l>The Roof was scarcely visible –</l>
             <l>The Cornice – in the Ground –</l>
             <l>Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet</l>
             <l>Feels shorter than the Day</l>
             <l>I first surmised the Horses' Heads </l>
             <l>Were toward Eternity –</l>

          <p>The poet's persona speaks about Death and Afterlife, the peace that comes along with it without haste. She personifies Death as a young man riding along with her in a carriage. As she goes through to the afterlife she briefs us of her past life while she was still alive.</p>
